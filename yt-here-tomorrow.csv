This can have two bonus effects:At  petals: the target will be healedAt 8 petals: the target will become invulnerable for .5 seconds and apply a heal and shield around them.E: lotus bomb: she throws a flower on to an enemy or teammate.If this hits a teammate, they will be shielded and given a 5 second chance to recall back too YunaraIf this hits an enemy, they will be blinded and she will harvest petals from them (based on level)Ult: petal dance: she lays down a long path which speeds up teammates, and increases their ability haste and attack speed, as well as giving her an infinite supply of petals.",0

2025-04-15T01:43:28Z,@FGTHGkGYJn,"State Representative Candidates: Ending the CrimeState representative candidate Alex Homich says it’s important for people to come together to prevent the atrocity of forced organ harvesting. “Now more than ever, I think it’s really time for people to open their eyes a little bit more to what’s going around,” he said, adding that it was very important for more people, especially the young generation, to learn about this. Having lived in Hong Kong from 202 to 205, state representative candidate Chris Beronio knew about the forced organ harvesting in China. But he was still shocked by the extent of control exerted by the CCP. “The movie was just absolutely incredible, very moving, and I would say, honestly scary, with some of the facts that are coming out about the forced organ harvesting in China. I was shocked by what I saw,” he said.State representative candidate Chris BeronioMr. Beronio said he admired Mr. Cheng’s survival and escape. “It’s just absolutely terrifying what his story was, though, and I hope I can help bring an end to that so that doesn’t happen to anybody else,” he stated. Exposing the AtrocitiesSome Chinese people also watched the documentary, including Delaware researcher Guo Jinchen and his wife. “I heard about this in the past, but the report was not vivid. Plus we have a witness today and his experience is very shocking,” said Guo. Mr. Guo believes the CCP cannot cover up the facts forever. “Some information will leak out. And we have been discussing this for a while. The documentary we watched here today provided more indepth details,” he said. He feels that more people need to know about this, adding, “We can help expose these brutalities to more people. This way they will learn what is really going on instead of following the CCP’s propaganda.”",1

Although CCP agents threatened the theater and audience members in an effort to stop the show, more people wished to see the documentary, so additional shows were added. After the special screening, a panel discussion was arranged. The panelists included Su Chihfen (former County Magistrate of Yunlin County), Liu Chienkuo (member of the Legislative Yuan), and others. A panel discussion was held after the special screening of State Organ at ShowTimes Cinemas at Beigang in Yunlin County.Perseverance in Opposing Brutalityormer Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chihfen (first from left) participated in the panel discussion.Su Chihfen, former County Magistrate of Yunlin County, said after the screening that the perseverance of alun Gong practitioners is admirable. “Their stories and the stories behind them are impressive, very touching and affirming,” she said. She said the CCP’s crimes of genocide against alun Gong practitioners, especially forced organ harvesting, are extremely cruel.What the CCP fears the most is alun Gong’s popularity. The regime used all kinds of torture, slander and rumors to defame alun Gong and tried to push people away from the practice. That’s also why Su called on people to come together to support the upright and oppose brutality. More People Need to Know ThisLiu Chienkuo, a member of the Legislative Yuan.Legislative Yuan member Liu Chienkuo said he felt sad after he watched the documentary. He said the crime of organ harvesting carried out by the CCP is a cruel act that violates humanity. It’s inhumane and unbelievable.“I will work on legislation against forced organ harvesting. The world needs to know the truth about organ harvesting,” he said. Liu encouraged everyone to pass on the information so that more people could condemn the persecution, from Taiwanese politicians, members of all political parties, and the public. Organ harvesting from living people should not be allowed to continue.Unbearable PainDing Rongzhe, Chairman of Yunlin County Medical Doctors Association.Ding Rongzhe is the chairman of the Yunlin County Medical Doctors Association and said he was deeply disturbed after watching the documentary. “In this documentary, each organ transplant case caused a series of tragedies for several families, and I felt very heavy after watching it,” he said. “The CCP treats people like animals. What’s even more cruel is that they don’t use anesthetics, so it’s very painful,” he added. “During the process of organ harvesting, people do not die immediately, which is unimaginable pain.“Should we still deal with such a regime? We are not antiChina, but we are against the Chinese Communist Party’s cruelty and inhumanity,” he said.A Lucrative Supply Chain",1

The video was beautiful but its strange to go from the lore cinematics to this... which wasnt even featuring many Ionian champions. Why did we see Ashe and Lux? Why not folks like Ahri or other more classic Ionian champs similar to what we got for noxus/split ,2
2025-04-14T16:01:54Z,@alistor_s,"Because spirit blossom was an event, if I remember, from 208209 which featured champions in an Ionian myth style of garb. They werent all Ionian and because its under the gise of myth, they can essentially put any champion in the skinline. If your confused its because the cinematic at the start of the year focused on direct lore connections from arcane. This one focuses on in direct connections from the overall story of the world .",0

Whether that be smaller projects, or more longterm projects like the next Runeterra show. ortiche obviously wont be doing every cinematic, that would be stupid and frustrating for everyone involved. Other studios need a chance to make cinematics, just like weve had for the last 5 years, and ortiche needs time to work on various projects. Its a winwin for everyone.",1
