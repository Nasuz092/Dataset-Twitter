Are you all really letting this slide?I remember a cinematic with VI and Urgot fighting and people were complaining in the comments how it didnt make sense for VI to be strong enough to beat him even though she had hextech gloves and Urgot isnt that much bigger than her compared to how much bigger is Trundle than Darius.,0

Anyone who is strong can be Noxian, regardless of origin, and they are always conquering new places, which leads to them probably being one of the most diverse nations in the game, besides Piltover/Zaun. As for inclusion, theyre not really opposed to it. Theyre fine with a big tent, because they want to include everyone strong enough to work toward their cause, albeit less for ideas and culture that would conflict with Noxian ideals of strength.Its really only equity that they do not care about, because they think that the strong should take it all.

The fight between the obvious top lane was interesting, the females fighting was also great, but I have no idea who that chick at the arch was. I dont care for riots show since they did have good animation, but the story fell short and was boring. Arcane def felt like a pandering type show to the low attention span types and soft emotional ones, the types who likely havent read a good book. Again the cinematic was great, just a part of it I have no idea wtf it was, and I have no interest in their show.

2025-01-08T03:39:46Z,@StoneLaRone,"This is showing the new show that Riot/ortiche are working on and had started working on midway through Arcane Season 2’s development. Riot’s goal, is that with Arcane they’d be able to go back to a “beginning phase” and from Arcane’s works building and storytelling be able to create new shows from pivoting characters in Arcabe. Hence, Mel for Noxus. Arcane was only ever to be 2 seasons, so Welcome to Noxus is the first branch from Riot’s creation on Arcane. And Riot stated that all LoL lore from Arcane will be canon so, this is the th time Riot will be reconning past lore, but now with the cinematics, TV shows/series (Like Arcane on Netflix), and hopefully a few movies it will create a more complete and understandable Runterra lore history and bring out the strength in both the major champions and fan favorites to highlight them for LoL plays and nonplayers alike. But just because Noxus is getting its own series and Demacia is being discussed does it mean that we won’t see characters like Caitlyn, Vi, Jinx or Ekko or Piltovee/Zaun, again, Chris and Alex just felt exploring the world of Runeterra like this would keep fans excited to see the growth of new characters for instance, before Mel became a mage or became aware of her magic born abilities she was a favorite among the main counselors but was a nonaction cast characters, but Season 2 showed fans her transformation, where as this trailer shows her growth and how she’s determined to ally with those looking to stop Le Blanc and hooked when the ones they fell for to begin with (Meaning the characters of Arcane) made a return.",0

2025-01-08T03:00:27Z,@evertonlimagomes2655,"Paron my novel but Im passionate about the world of Runeterra. So basically the League champions we have in this cinematic are Katarina (red haired girl, an assassin), Elise (spider lady, Black Rose), Trundle (the troll), Darius (the Noxus guy), Vladimir (the vampire guy, Black Rose) and LeBlanc (the woman at the end, leader of the Black Rose). Despite the Black Rose being in Noxus, they are still an enemy to Swain and the other Noxian leaders. Thats why Katarina is trying to assassinate someone at a Black Rose party. I COULD be wrong on this but I believe the reason theyre enemies is because the Black Rose wants to keep Mordekaiser locked away, whereas knowing Noxus, they probably want to use Mordekaiser in their invasion conquests. Mordekaiser was also the one who founded Noxus.The way Noxus works is Swain overthrew the old leader of Noxus because he didnt want corruption in a leadership role. So he takes over control as the leader of Noxus. However, to prevent future corruption he forms the Trifarix which is where there are three leaders of Noxus so if one of them goes corrupt the other two can deal with them. Each one represents 3 principles. Principle of Vision which is Swain (he is possessed by a demon that HE can control and utilize its power). Thats why you see a 6 eyed crow at the end of Arcane that he uses as his own surveillance system. Principle of Might, which is Darius who is the general of the Noxian army as well. And the last is the Principle of Guile which at this point even League players dont really know who it is, but theyre referred to as The aceless.Us as League players KNOW Darius is strong, considering hes one of the Trifarix leaders and also the leader of arguably one of the biggest and strongest armies in Runeterra, however weve kind of just been told hes stronk but never really shown. But thats whats really cool about the cinematic is hes fighting Trundle, A LITERAL TROLL TWICE HIS SIZE and is wielding a true ice club. True Ice is different than normal ice. True Ice weapons generally can kill anybody who touches it unless they are Iceborn. Its an unbearable pain to even the people who are able to wield it. So the fact that Darius picks it up, feels that pain and proceeds to try to beat Trundle up with his bare fists without really being weakened by it impressive to say the least. And then when he has no other choice he finally picks up his axe, wielding that True Ice and is able to knock out Trundle. Maybe not unscathed but at least not dead like most people who would try to wield True Ice. This intrigues me a lot to know what the story with that is because as far as I knew it was only Iceborn who could wield it, not just really strong people. But Darius and Draven (his brother) are orphans just like Vi and Jinx so they could probably come up with a reason as to why Darius is able to wield the True Ice (maybe their mom was from the reljord or something).As far as Noxus as a whole goes, they have always been considered the bad guys but I think theyre morally grey, just like Silco. If I remember correctly, they do terrible things with good intentions in mind. I could be wrong as its been a while since Ive really read up on Noxus but I THINK they basically want to unite Runeterra under one entire nation to prevent conflict and war but they do it by starting wars and invasions... But I believe the reason they think the way they do is because there have been regions within Runeterra that have gone to war with each other and have caused severe threats and consequences to the rest of Runeterra because of their actions. or example, Ixtal went to war with Shurima and basically opened up a gate to the Void (think the Upside Down from Stranger Things) to use in their battle against Shurima, only for that plan to backfire and cause a serious threat to Runeterra as a whole. So I think in Noxus mind they are just trying to unite all of Runeterra to prevent any future conflicts such as this.There is days upon days of reading and videos you can intake on all of League of Legends lore, the world is massive and every facet of it from the history, regions, and champions are all INCREDIBLY interesting. Hence why I went on this big long rant and please let me know if I got anything wrong and Ill correct it. Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED talk.This text its not mine, just want to share with you guys.",5

2025-01-07T23:56:57Z,@saratailor,this made me tear up a little because the animation is just so beautiful. but also the fact that the characters from arcane are gone makes me sad. the fans have a strong connection with them. its sad that it seems that its over for them. but still this video has the best animation i have ever seen.,0
2025-01-08T00:36:07Z,@cababom4013,"dont worry, leagues lore is enourmous. Arcane characters cannot be on this next season but they can show up at any time, due to the lore connecting everything in Runeterra(leagues world). Piltover was connected with Noxus by the money and tecnology piltover created, probably Noxus wil be connected with another region (probably Ionia) due to the war. Arcane characters will show up",0

And thank you to the people working on the game, you guys are the ones more like me, strategy games for life.I dont play LOL anymore but it was a huge part of my life as my main game from when I moved to it from SC2 in Season 3 to a few years ago when I reached my 30s and my wife. So now I can safely say, the art, music and videos and art are absolutely amazing even for someone no longer passionately obsessed with the game. Congratulations on your achievement.",334

2025-01-07T23:46:37Z,@genleroy,It is basically a show trailer and the new season of league of legends trailer wrapped up in one.

Which is understandable, LoL was never really that kind of game. The lore was always more pretty background dressing for the pvp heavy game based off the WC3 mechanics. Hardly a AAA immersive story driven narrative like Witcher 3 or even the allout series. More of the non league players just wanted more of the series or large game tieins that were character story or RPG focused. But season 2 was a tad rushed, and the show was just too expensive to continue to make. Especially since Riot hasnt found a way to capitalize on its success.",2

The animation is beautiful, the portrayal of the characters is shown in every movement they make, the amount of parallels and connections they make is unmatched, I have recommended this show to pretty much every person who will stay long enough to listen. And the fact that the richness of its world as well as the richness of the characters is so amazing. Arcane was what 250 million dollars worth of production SHOULD look like. I can’t wait for this show and the content from my favourite creators will come with it.P.S. dont even get me started on the art style, the designs, and the voice acting!",9

2025-01-07T21:15:24Z,@ryuukail,"or anyone wondering what happened to Darius’s (axe guy) arm and why he threw away his weapon (minor spoilers):In the rejliord (the icy region) there is this thing called true ice that typically kills people on contact or after short exposure. A rare few are born with the ability to touch true ice without dying, and we call them “Iceborn”. While they can wield it, they still feel immense pain while doing so. Trundle (likely the troll in the MV) and some other LoL champs like Ashe, Olaf, Braum, etc. are said Iceborn. Darius, being from Noxus, is very likely not Iceborn. When his weapon gets stuck in the True Ice weapon, it gets consumed by it and he is no longer able to use his axe. At the end of the fight he manages to grab the handle for a brief moment and win, but it probably did irreversible damage to his hand and forearm. My understanding is that most people would be lucky to survive contact for even that long, but Darius stroNK so he lives. Lore nerds, please correct me if I’m wrong.",0

2025-01-07T21:06:55Z,@A_hyungnim,So this confirms it. This was before Darkwills assassination and Noxus Invasion of Ionia. How? Because Darius is fighting Trundle. He first fought Trundle right after he became the Hand of Noxus. Then they went back to Noxus and found out Darkwill was assassinated by Swain. Swain gave Darius a place as part of the Trifarian Legion. Then the Ionian Invasion happened where well see Darius wife Quiletta apart of it. Also while they were invading Ionia Noxus also attacked reljord where Darius son Decius died.(Im still questioning wholl replace Singed in the Ionian Invasion. Since he technically got Orianna back.),1

These 2 are the pillars of Noxus, with Darius (the guy with the axe) as the 3rd pillar fighting Trundle, a troll from jelord in this cinematic.We will very probably see them using Singed to create some sort of chemical bomb to attack Ionia, a very very beautiful world setting with arguably better stories than Arcane.

2025-01-07T20:05:20Z,@DanteYewToob,"It’s a different style than Arcane but looks incredible. It’s a bit less painterly but it fits this more hard edged style. It’s cool that they’re giving different stories slightly different looks while keeping the overall quality and style intact. Piltover and Zaun fit the more painterly style, they’re all about innovation style and individuality… things are all imperfect and it artistic and it worked..Noxus is more rigid, and this style fits the more architectural and brutalist aesthetic of the places and people we’re seeing. They strive for perfection and the art feels a bit more “perfect” and refined than Arcane, but it also lost a little of the hand painted look. But that’s not a bad thing, it’s just different. I’d love to see maybe watercolor style in Bandle City with bright and natural colors as a base with wild pops of saturation, something kinda sketchy and rough for Bilgewater with visible sketch lines and darker flatter colors… stuff like that! Arcane looks like a moving painting, this looks more clean and refined and I’m excited to see what they do next!",44

This is completly done on purpose and it greatly shows the noxian power and philosophy. In contrast Demacians tend to be a mix between defense and offense, you know this because of many demacians Ws go for defense and shield (Garen, Lux, Jarvan, Galio, iora, Kayle, Poppy) and I JUST LOVE THAT, that is pure and perfect balance between gameplay and storytelling of the regions.",0

2025-01-07T19:11:30Z,@stefwolf1301,WILD theory here.. but the thing Leblanc is panting or forseeing in the black ink or magic or whatever. it looks like a dagger with sumthin in the middle.. I had a crazy thought.. If i remember correctly it was a noxian that was sent to retrieve Naafiri the dagger or the black rose send someone random to get her. Dosent rly mean much as she is in shurima and for her to play a part in noxus is unlikely. but It would set a time frame meaning Naafiri was released during or right before Arcane or after. Its just a theory i had. since most of the scribbles could refer to Monster. then the one before darius back. and then the last one Leblanc and vlad stares at. Could also be a catalyst for whats going on in noxus for the next series. it picks up after arcane but also the black rose has just found out they failed to retrieve a darkin weapon and we will see the aftermath of that? hope riot will hopefully clear up the drawings or necrit will.,0
2025-01-07T19:14:41Z,@stefwolf1301,Actually rewatching it when vladimir is walking in on Leblanc the painting to his left looks a helluva lot like a dog. or a vauge image of Naafiri.,0
2025-01-07T19:16:27Z,@stefwolf1301,But if riot is setting up Naafiri playing a part in the noxus series or will come to noxus or black rose will set after her. OML seeing a darkin in a show is gonna be like seeing warwick for the first time in arcane for me O_O,0

That does not mean, that the invasion of Ionia did not happen yet, because Arcane has its own story and timeline. Maybe the next LoLshow in Noxus shows the start of the invasion of Ionia and Swain will loose his arm sonner/later in the show (singed could be hired in the meantime to help killing the ionians), or Ionia is already invaded and swain will be introduced with an missing arm/has Raum in a different way by his side.",0

2025-01-08T04:57:00Z,@hiimchrisj,"Actually, Im noticing a subtle difference between how ortiche designs character models for these modern League cinematics versus what they did in Arcane. While Arcane is less exaggerated than like anime for instance, and intentionally design their characters to have imperfections and less dolllike features, they still have a bit of a Disney quality to them with big bright eyes and slightly pushed proportions so everyone has really distinct silhouettes. And the irises have this artificial octagon like shape to them with really exaggerated specular highlights that look like a 2d drawing effect rather than a normal reflection. With the League cinematics like this and Blood Sweat and Tears, it feels like its even more grounded in its aesthetics. Darius looks built like John Cena as opposed to the big hulking mass of a man he is in League, something which Arcane certainly would tone down but wouldnt deviate from too much. Eyes are smaller and more naturalistic looking with actually round irises and more subtle specular highlights. And while it still has the same painted texture effect, everythings blended more so it looks less sharp and sculpted and instead looks more natural.",0

Maybe a certain someone knew she would be problematic from the very beginning and tried to get rid of her while she was weak.,4

2025-01-07T18:03:27Z,@Chris-eh8mi,"Theres so much good about this that just doesnt need to be said because others have said it all, so instead I will focus on the one thing that really bothered me (and it bothers me about Arcane more and more). In the Troll (maybe Trundle, maybe not since there were other trolls shown after) v Darius fight, when the presumed Trundle has Darius dead to rights, there is zero reason for him to lose. None. Nada. Zip. Trundle is stronger by far. Trundle has his head in his grasp. Nothing Darius is doing is mechanically acting to prevent Trundle from ripping his throat out with his teeth or even simply just tearing his head off of his shoulders. The moment goes on and on and on and Darius is completely at his mercy and Trundle just does nothing. And theres no explanation for it; theres no reason for it; and it really kills the gritty realism of the fist fight that otherwise was fantastic, even cutting out the music for the thuds of the fists to be more deeply felt and impactful. All great stuff right up until it was terribly concluded. or some, this is probably minor, but for me it takes me out of the scene completely and just looks like the fight ended the way it did because script and not because of the actual journey we went on in the fight. Darius had his armor stripped off and then was given plot armor; and that feels awful for an audience imo.",0

I really hope season 3 of Arcane will capture the brutal meritocracy where the strong, the cunning and the mad reign supreme. I especially hope we will get to see Jericho Swain clashing in a battle of wits with LeBlanc. I also love how those characters we love look reimagined, especially Elise who while looking less monstrous in her human form still looks incredibly inhuman due to her complete lack of emotion. Also, Vlad is once again bloody amazing (pun intended), glad they ditched this Wild Rift soul magic and came back to the actual blood magic, I really hope THIS will what will be the basis of his eventual visual update.",1

Now she inhabits all of them, and any others she assimilates, into her own hivemind of them…And what’s worse is that, after an initial moment of adjustment, she’s begun to REVEL in her newfound form and freedom, and  also it’s made her smarter/wiser about the values of working together.",1

2025-01-07T17:28:53Z,@emilio.m.c3713,it does make sense for the cinematic but story wise i find it a bit odd that katarina has such an extended open fight with elise when clearly her goal was to assasinate her target. a quick in and out so to speak. i hope this fight isnt part of the actual story and just for the cinematic. if her goal was to quickly assasinate her target without revealing her identitiy i would imagine she would try to escape as fast as possible especially when she failed. this whole fightscene might look cool but doesnt make a lot of sense. also her eyes need to be much greener. maybe they are doing the thing were the eyes are greyish at first and when she has character developement her eyes will change but idk im not 00% sold on this depiction of katarina. overall im pretty concerned with how they are going to change katarinas original fiction in this story. when they first showed her face i thought it was caitlyn. only after i saw the daggers is realized that this was supposed to be kata. is it just me or does she look old here? i feel like she should look younger. she kinda looks like in her mid 30s here. i would have prefered if shes more like in her late 20s,1

2025-01-07T17:08:17Z,@romanbowler8754,"ortiche and everyone else who worked on this knocked themselves out of the park! My respect goes to you people. Id say the pause in the track where Darius and Trundle have their fight is one of my favorite parts. No music, just an attempt at fighting through it. It succeeded in making me feel uncomfortable when Darius was put in a rough position. I appreciate how he can manage putting up a fight yet still struggles with tackling Trundle because of their differences. Cant write enough about how much I love how you folk convey weight in animation. That specific shot at :8 is also trippy and reminds me of Jayce and his hallucinations from S2, or when the trio touched the Arcane. And this shot as well  is just unnerving, love that we got the spider vision of her seeing several versions of her as well. Its a fine line between it, but sometimes ortiche taps into horror elements and it works wonderfully. The way those legs crawl on the wall, move, those slight twitches in her head that you can see in spiders or similar animals/insects. I always love the color selection that ortiche uses, its not too bright and puts your eyes on ease, but we see lots of different ones like characters with pink hair or yellow eyes. Its more in the muted palette so when there is something bright, it stands out the way it should. No matter, its very nuanced. And in its designs its all so intricate. Mels markings and the golden lines of the clothes are always made in creative patterns. Theyre recognizable, yet you can notice something different each time you look at it. Cant get enough of the expressions, everything matters. The way they fight, like in , rough and sharp, yet acrobatic in a sense. Their cocky facial expressions or determination to win, it brings their personalities forward. And for Mel in this, her searching and longing gaze, wishing to understand is portrayed so well. Only when she fights does it change. She looks even more mature in this. Thank you for all your amazing work, ortiche. Outstanding as always. Hope the workers get their well deserved rest so that pumping out projects like this can happen. We wouldnt want burnout to happen. Your guys attention to detail seems like it comes from a place of love for the craft. Its respected.",108

2025-01-07T17:07:49Z,@MantaRay117,Been here for an hour watching it over and over again so here is some things that makes this cinematic great) Mell is starting to resemble Ambessa (facial expressions too)2) True ice finally showcased destroying Darius axe3) Trundle being so raw fighting Darius and dropping his weapon when his opponents’ gets destroyed) Katarina using ingame abilities with their sound effects 5) Elise  point of view when she transforms 6) Elise doesnt transform until Katarina’s target dies. That means she either doesnt want to be seen in her true form or Black Rose didnt care about the target and just wanted Katarina dead 7) Le Blanc writings on wall represents Katarina and Elise (from what i can see right before Elise attacks)8)  You can see Darius’s old axe on the new map on top side. And his arm is permanently damaged now.,273

I know some people arent thrilled with it changing some of the lore but I think its really lit a fire in terms of storytelling visually and even gameplay wise. I dont think we see stuff like this and themed seasons without the success of Arcane and I think well be feeling the effects of that for years to come. I for one am excited and intrigued because this seems like a trial, something that can be returned to when the Demacia, Noxus and Ionia shows come out. I hope those shows come out sooner rather than later, (if for no other reason than to see a certain blue haired girl again). This is good stuff Riot. But man we owe those guys and gals over at Arcane more than we can possibly fathom I think. Im going to cope and say if they can cook up cinematics like this in what Im guessing is a relatively short time surely we can get the next show this year.... surely....",0

2025-01-07T16:52:39Z,@TylPhumin,"I see where ortiche is going ._. they cant make male characters pretty . Why Vlad feeling off/ugly?And Darius feels Anemic. Almost like Garen drowning in the hure armor. I hope they dont do the same thing to KSante and Sett when the time comes XDPersonally I dont like it as much just from the structure.. too much Dialogue and pauses of music. I guess I prefer the Music Video with 3 story lines, as opposed to Arcane style I have no time so I cut 3 storylines within music cuts xdBut certainly didnt expect trundle here.Also, why is Ezreal never getting screen time? Piltover: nawh. a skinline he is part off: naah.. .",0

I think we will witness the invasion of Ionia in the next series, and the downfall of the Black Rose because thats what Mel is going to do and finally the installation of the Trifarix. They show a raven which represents Raum (Swains demon) watching everything. Also Darius looks much younger.

And all this blood will catch up to them one day. All brutes fall, sooner or later. Because they simply refuse to accept where their limits are. Breaking through your limits sounds nice, sure.

Le blancs whole thing is deception too much gold draws attention.

BUT RIOT DOING ANOTHER DAGGER darkin? Also this one its different cos, not only its locked into a weapon but also somewhere else as we see leblanc fingering the air.Then i tought about trundle... why we get the frejlord in this video? Also theres an Eye on the dagger... so 2+2 = watchers. (and i start to belive the theory that says that lb might be one of the reincarnations(?) of the three sisters... shes also called pale witch, which by using logic means shes born in a cold place)But colors do not make sense once again.Also, Leblanc its possibly WRITING in the air or the white smoke, as the NEXUS style symbols are not used by either demons , darkins and watchers. So leblanc its casting some kind of magic.i think MEL seems to see the future... which is a huge deal. HUUUUGE DEAL.",0

That slugfest between him and Darius was literal perfection.Also happy to see Elise making her appearance. I know shes a part of the Black Rose, but a part of me was worried that she would get left on the sidelines for more prominent Noxian Champions.And Leblanc... What else can I say. Her shadow form in Season 2 already looked amazing, but this right here is a perfect rework of her ingame design. And I love the detail of Vladimir looking similar to Viego, considering theyre related.",80

Cause honestly, a lot of Champions are in need of some updating. Glad theyve already done that for Viktor at least.Im curious, is this simply a tease for what may come in Arcane S2 or is a lot of the plot threads that was teased for Noxus going to be explored in LoL game stuff and cinematics? Either way its great to see them seizing the story potentials Arcane created more!",0

2025-01-07T16:55:10Z,@chrishaven1489,"@@panpan757 Its clear you havent read the lore either. Taking into account the retconning of Trundles size, Trundle is wielding a True Ice weapon, a staple of actual power in the reljord. And Darius beat him for some reason. If it was just a normal club, I could see Darius winning. But Darius beating a fullsized Iceborn troll wielding a True Ice weapon, just shows that True Ice weapons arent that big of a deal, and thats an unacceptable retcon.Elise got bitten by a spider god. Her powers make her a defacto Aspect. or all intents and purposes, she is a spider goddess. Someone as powerful as Elise wouldnt be afraid of someone like Katarina, whos just a normal human girl with knives.",0
2025-01-07T17:02:18Z,@panpan4757,"@@chrishaven89 it really doesnt make an aspect tho, if anything its described as a curse, sure theres upsides, but it didnt make her a goddess. also katarina uses blood magic imbued into her knives, so while she is human, shes still using magic weaponry. also u can see the damage holding the true ice (which wasnt even directly, he picked up his axe which has been frozen) did in just a second or two to his arm.",0

I dont know how much this is gonna tie into arcane, but if anyone actually read the lore, they would know it would make infinitely more sense if the next series were set in Ionia. Not Noxus. A lot of Noxus champion backstories dont get interesting until during and after the Ionian Invasion.With everyone wanting the next series set in Noxus, theres a very real risk the creators are gonna demolish wellestablished lore, which is really, really good as is, just to get all fanservicey.It makes more sense that the story focuses on Ionia and the invasion first. And then do another series focusing on Swains rise to power. Give both regions the time and respect they deserve rather than halfassing both.But this Noxiancentric cinematic isnt alleviating my concerns for the future of storytelling set in this world",0

2025-01-06T16:43:47Z,@Gradeient,@@cboymemes58 I love Arcane but at the same time I wish theyd use different animation styles.,81
2025-01-06T17:12:13Z,@Lesdrasill,"@@Gradeient they literally do use different styles. Its just a production perspective, youve been using ortiche style for the rest of the year with Arcane, why not add Noxus to the billables and keep Arcane momentum to keep new audiences interested.",225
2025-01-06T17:23:03Z,@KingAxel94,"@@Lesdrasill Well I agree to a degree, but every arcane fan reaction i watched (providing that they didnt just act) was in awe for the closeup on Pantheons eyes or Tryndamere. So I dont think it is thaat inportant. I also hoped to see a similar style like last season cinematics. Well im satisfied as long as they dont repeat 2023 :D",13
2025-01-06T17:49:19Z,@Lesdrasill,"@@KingAxel9 Oh I love that too. Still Here is still one of the best cinematics so far. Its unfortunate that this is not the case this time, but Id also be happier if they utilized different styles. Season cinematics still rock and we dont remember what happened in 2023 xD",3
